# D2GSChecker

!! update - added threading so its much faster if you have loads of servers !!

This basic tool will take a list of D2GS servers, telnet into them at a configurable length of time (default: 60 seconds) and tell us a status of the server - is it up, how many users, how many games.

Like I said, this is basic. I just built it as I needed something quickly, feel free to modify or use as you need.

I could build in support to do PvPGN status and numbers also. If people are interested, get me on Discord - meanski or open an issue here.

## Configuration

Use the config.json file to configure what you need.
